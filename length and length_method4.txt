Difference between length and length()
 1) length-
* An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of same type.
* The length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. is number stored in an array.
* Once arrays are initialized,its length cannot of an changed.
* The length variable is used only for an array.

 Example -class ArryList{
public static void main(String arges[]){
int ar[]={1,2,3,4,5,6}
System.out.println("length is"+ar.length);
}
}

2) Length()-
* The length() method is a Static method of String class.
* The length() returns the length of a String object. the number of characters Stored in an object.
* String class uses this method because  the length of a String can be modified using various on an object. 

  Example-
          class String{
             public static void main(String arges[]){
                  String str=" hi Avinash";
                  System.out.println("Length() is"+ str.length());
                 }
               }



  3) Multiple Inhertiance

    * it refers to the subclass having more than one superclass.
    * it cannot usingclass but using interface we can achivee.
    *  it cannot be supported to the java-
      because 
      1) When one class having more than one super class that time       sub class get the ambiguity to aquire the properties of the       object class

   4) Hibrid inhertiance
     * it is the combination of more than one type of inhertiance
      * it also gives the ambigutiy problem.


    5)   For Each Loop
          
       * For each loop  is used to traverse the array or collection           in java.
        * it makes the code readable.
       * it eliminates the possibility of programming errors.
  
    Syntax
            
      for(data_type variable : array){
       // body of for each loop
       
           }
